      "question": "What tools do you use?",
      "answer": "Primarily ClickUp for project management, Claude AI for intelligent automation, and custom integrations. I recommend tools based on your specific needs, not what pays me the highest affiliate commission."

      "question": "Do I need to be tech-savvy to work with you?",
      "answer": "No. I build systems for people who don't want to think about technology. You'll get training and documentation, and the goal is always simplicity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where are you based?",
      "answer": "I work remotely with clients worldwide. Most of my clients are in the US, but I've worked with agencies in Canada, UK, and Australia."

    {
      "question": "How did you get into this?",
      "answer": "I spent years as a travel coordinator building the systems that nobody else wanted to build. Eventually I realized the systems were more valuable than any single trip I could book."
