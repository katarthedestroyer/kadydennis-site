      <!-- Story -->
      <section class="prose-custom mb-12">
        <p>
          Before I became an operations consultant, I spent years as a travel coordinator at a busy agency. I booked trips, managed suppliers, tracked commissions, and—like everyone else—built my own hodgepodge of spreadsheets and workarounds to keep it all together.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing is: I actually liked the systems part. While other advisors dreaded updating their tracking sheets, I was figuring out how to make mine update automatically. While they forgot follow-ups, I was building sequences that sent themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually I realized the systems I was building were more valuable than any individual trip I could book. Other advisors started asking me to build similar systems for them. Then agency owners. Then small businesses outside travel who had the same problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I made it official. Now I help travel advisors and small service businesses stop drowning in operations and start scaling—with systems that actually work.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Approach -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="mb-6">My Approach</h2>
        <div class="prose-custom">
          <p>
            I believe in systems that are <strong>simple enough to actually use</strong>. The best workflow is one you'll follow consistently—not a complex masterpiece that looks impressive but never gets updated.
          </p>
          <p>
            I primarily work with <strong>ClickUp</strong> for project management because it's powerful enough for complex workflows but intuitive enough that you won't need a PhD to use it. For AI-powered automation, I use <strong>Claude</strong> and custom integrations that actually make sense for your business.
          </p>
          <p>
            My clients are typically:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Travel advisors</strong> booking $300K+ annually who need to get off the hamster wheel</li>
            <li><strong>Small agencies</strong> (2-10 people) struggling to scale without chaos</li>
            <li><strong>Service businesses</strong> with client-heavy workflows who need better systems</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I don't do cookie-cutter solutions. Every system is built for how <em>your</em> business actually works—not how some template assumes it should work.
          </p>
