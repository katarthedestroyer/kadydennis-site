          This Refund Policy applies to purchases made through Eliava Travel and is designed to be consistent with our Service Agreements and scopes of work.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Services (Consulting)</h2>
        <p>
          Because consulting services involve reserved capacity and work performed to specification, refunds are handled as follows unless a signed agreement states otherwise:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Before work begins:</strong> Any deposit or prepayment is refundable upon written request.</li>
          <li><strong>After work begins:</strong> Deposits are non-refundable. We will provide any work completed to date and/or a summary of progress as applicable.</li>
          <li><strong>Project payments:</strong> If milestone or final payments have been made and services have already been delivered, those payments are generally non-refundable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Digital Deliverables (Templates, Documents, Configurations)</h2>
        <p>
          If a purchase includes downloadable digital materials, access is typically granted immediately. Due to the nature of digital goods, these purchases are non-refundable unless required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Payment Processor Fees</h2>
        <p>
          If a refund is issued for a Stripe card payment, processing fees may not be recoverable from Stripe. Where permitted, refunds may be net of non-refundable processing fees.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Chargebacks</h2>
        <p>
          If you have a billing issue, please contact us at <a href="mailto:kady@eliavatravel.com">kady@eliavatravel.com</a> before initiating a chargeback so we can resolve it quickly. Unauthorized chargebacks may result in suspension of services and/or access.
        </p>
