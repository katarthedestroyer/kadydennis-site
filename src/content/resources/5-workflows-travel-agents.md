Stop reinventing the wheel. This guide shows you exactly which tasks to automate first—and how to do it without expensive software or a tech team. These five workflows represent the highest-impact automation opportunities for travel advisors, based on real agency implementations that save 10+ hours per week.

## Why These 5 Workflows?

Not all automation is created equal. These workflows were selected based on three criteria: frequency (you do them constantly), time cost (each instance takes significant effort), and error risk (manual handling leads to mistakes that cost money).

Travel agencies that automate these five processes report:
- 10-15 hours saved per week
- 90% reduction in missed follow-ups
- 40% faster response times to inquiries
- Near-zero commission tracking errors

## Workflow #1: Lead Intake and Qualification

Every inquiry that hits your inbox starts the same cycle: respond, ask qualifying questions, wait for answers, follow up, repeat. Automate this.

**What to automate:**
- Instant acknowledgment email when inquiry received
- Qualifying questionnaire sent automatically
- Responses captured and organized without manual entry
- Follow-up sequence if questionnaire not completed

**Tools needed:** Form builder (Typeform, Google Forms, or JotForm), email automation (ConvertKit, Mailchimp, or ClickUp), CRM or spreadsheet

**Time saved:** 2-3 hours per week for advisors handling 10+ inquiries weekly

## Workflow #2: Booking Confirmation and Document Delivery

After a booking is confirmed, you send the same types of documents every time: confirmation details, payment schedule, travel insurance reminders, destination guides. This should run itself.

**What to automate:**
- Booking confirmation email with all relevant details
- Document package delivery (visa requirements, packing lists, destination info)
- Payment reminder sequence
- Pre-departure checklist delivery (timed to departure date)

**Tools needed:** Email automation with date-based triggers, document storage (Google Drive or Dropbox), CRM with booking date fields

**Time saved:** 1-2 hours per booking; scales dramatically with volume

## Workflow #3: Commission Tracking and Reconciliation

If you're tracking commissions in a spreadsheet you update manually, you're losing money. Guaranteed. Missed entries, calculation errors, and forgotten follow-ups on unpaid commissions are bleeding your business.

**What to automate:**
- Automatic entry when booking confirmed (pulled from booking system or manual trigger)
- Expected commission calculation based on supplier rates
- Payment due date tracking
- Alert when commission not received by expected date
- Reconciliation report generation

**Tools needed:** ClickUp, Airtable, or Notion with calculation fields; automated reminders; integration with booking source if possible

**Time saved:** 3-5 hours per month; prevents $1,000s in missed commissions annually

## Workflow #4: Client Communication Sequences

The emails you send repeatedly—trip countdowns, feedback requests, anniversary check-ins, referral asks—should not require you to remember and manually send each one.

**What to automate:**
- Pre-trip countdown sequence (departure minus 30, 14, 7, 1 days)
- Post-trip thank you and feedback request
- Annual travel planning reminder
- Birthday and travel anniversary messages
- Referral request (timed appropriately after positive feedback)

**Tools needed:** Email automation with tagging/segmentation, CRM with key dates, template library

**Time saved:** 2-4 hours per week; dramatically improves client retention

## Workflow #5: Supplier Payment and Deadline Tracking

Final payment dates, deposit deadlines, cancellation windows—miss one and you're either paying out of pocket or losing a booking. Never rely on memory or sticky notes.

**What to automate:**
- Deadline entry when booking created
- Alert sequence (30, 14, 7, 3, 1 days before deadline)
- Client payment reminder emails
- Team notifications for upcoming deadlines
- Post-deadline confirmation capture

**Tools needed:** Project management with deadline fields and automations (ClickUp recommended), email templates, dashboard view for upcoming deadlines

**Time saved:** 1-2 hours per week; eliminates costly missed deadlines

## Implementation Priority

Start with the workflow causing you the most pain right now. For most advisors, that's either:

1. **Commission Tracking** — if you're losing money
2. **Lead Intake** — if you're drowning in inquiries
3. **Client Communication** — if follow-up is inconsistent

You don't need to implement all five at once. Pick one, build it properly, use it for 30 days, then move to the next.

## What You'll Need

**Minimum tech stack for all 5 workflows:**
- ClickUp (free tier works for basics) OR Notion/Airtable
- Email automation (ConvertKit, Mailchimp, or ActiveCampaign)
- Form builder (Typeform or JotForm for professional look)
- Zapier or Make.com for connecting tools (optional but powerful)

**Budget:** $0-100/month depending on tools chosen

## Next Steps

1. **Pick your first workflow** based on biggest pain point
2. **Map the current process** — write out every step you do manually
3. **Identify the trigger** — what starts this workflow?
4. **Build the automation** — start simple, add complexity later
5. **Test with real scenarios** before going live
6. **Document the workflow** for future reference and team training
